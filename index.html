  </h1>

  <p>Ticket to Ride is one of the best board games ever! It is an absolute favorite to play with family or friends! Even
    if you own one game board you never get tired of playing it over and over.</p>

  <h1>Why time to count?</h1>
  <img src="points.jpg" alt="Ticket to Ride points table" width="600">
  <p>The rules indicate that route points are to be counted during gameplay, as the routes are built. I have found that
    it is more enjoyable to count these points at the end of the game. I believe moving the score trackers during
    gameplay distracts from the esence of what is the most fun of the game. The game is best enjoyed in a fast pace
    where everyone is very much submerged in their world of keeping track of destination tickets and making the critical
    decision every turn.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do I get more train car cards to build may routes quickly, or do I quickly build that route before someone else
      gets it?</li>
    <li>Does building this route give away the path I am building?</li>
    <li>Are any of the available car train card colors any good for my plans, or do I get more destination tickets to
      try to score more points?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you stop every time you build a route to move your score tracker you get a bit distracted from thinking about
    all these decisions you can take.</p>
  <p>It seems that many other players around the world also believe that counting points at the end is the best way to
    enjoy the game. With the Time to Count app this is done smoothly and the app helps avoid errors. Install the Time to
    count app directly from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.timetocount"> Google Play
      Store!</a></p>

  <h1>Enjoying every moment of play</h1>
  <p> Let's be realistic, it isn't always easy to find the time to play a Ticket to Ride game. And you not only need
    time, you need other players to be with you and have the time to play.</p>
  <p>Deciding on playing a game is to start to enjoy this game. If you have more than one game board then you can decide
    which one to play. You might even have to decide where in the house to play.</p>
  <p>Before you actually start playing you have to set the board, decide on how to sit around the table and who goes
    first! This is the first part of enjoying the time with family or friends to play Ticket to Ride.</p>
  <p>After all the preparations are done comes the meat of it all. It is the time for gameplay. Get car train cards,
    build routes and complete as many destination tickets as you can! A fast and exciting moment of adrenaline from all
    the competition! This goes on until that last turn when someone takes that leap of faith and finishes his or hers
    car trains hoping to beat the rest.</p>
  <p>That's when Time to Count comes in! Now everyone helps out in getting all the routes, destination tickets and bonus
    info in to see how the players rank with their final scores. This is the last moment of the game and to be enjoyed
    like all the rest of the moments!</p>

  <h1>The simple app mechanics</h1>
  <p>The app knows all the differences for each game board variant. So all you have to do is input the information on
    how each player played and the scores are done automatically.</p>
  <p>You can input information in any order you want, but it seems natural to do routes first, then destination tickets
    and last bonuses.</p>
  <p>For routes, you input all the routes of each player. You look at the board and with a simple tap you enter every
    route built. The app shows you the points scored for routes. The app knows how many train cars are in game for each
    game board variant, so it conveniently shows how many unused train cars. This helps make a check at the end to see
    that it matches the number of actual unused train cars. Even for variants that count routes differently we use the
    same mechanic. Later we explain in detail each variant.</p>
  <p>Destination tickets are also done per player. Looking at the board you first check which destination tickets were
    completed and which where not. You then go to the app that shows buttons with the ticket points. Since the app knows
    every game board variant you are shown only the points for that variant. You input completed destination tickets and
    those that went uncompleted as well. You tap on the buttons for complete and incomplete to switch between these.</p>
  <h1>Bonuses for all extensions made easy</h1>
  <p>Every variant has some bonus points awarded. Some of them are done with no need to input more information.</p>
  <p>The <b>globetrotter bonus</b> is automatically awarded to the player (or players in case of a tie) that have the
    most completed destination tickets. The app knows how many points to award for each game board variant.</p>
  <p>The default method for the <b>long route bonus</b> is to input for each player the longest route in train cars. The
    app awards the game variant's bonus points for long route the the player(s) with the longest route. The other option
    is to simply mark in the app who are the players with the longest route so the app awards the corresponding bonus.
    In the app options screen you can decide for what method to use.</p>
  <p>The <b>Europe</b> variant has the stations that need to be counted for bonus points. Indicate how many stations
    were used and the app will award 4 points per each unused station as bonus.</p>
  <p>The <b>MÃ¤rklin</b> variant include the merchandise tokens bonus. Input the final number of merchandise tokens per
    each player.</p>
  <img src="railssails.jpeg" alt="Rails and Sails bonus points table" width="600">
  <p>For the <b>Rails and Sails</b> game boards the ports give bonus points. Input for each port how many destination
    tickets were completed and bonus points are awarded according to the bonus table for each game board.</p>
  <p>The <b>Germany</b> game board awards points for passengers. At the end of the game input how many passengers for
    each color each player has. The app awards points according to the rules.</p>
  <p>For the <b>Asia</b> game board indicate how many train cars were used for mountain routes. The app awards 2 points
    per train car used for mountains. The app considers also counts the train cars set aside because of mountain routes
    for the purpose of checking how many were left unused at the end of the game. </p>
  <p>The <b>India</b> game board offers players the change to win the Grand Tour Bonus according to mandalas built. For
    each player input the amount of destination tickets completed inside a mandala and the app awards the bonus
    according to the table in the rules.</p>
  <img src="africa.jpeg" alt="Rails and Sails bonus points table" width="600">
  <p>For the <b>Heart of Africa</b> the bonuses are awarded for building routes using terrain cards. In order to be able
    to count points at the end, for this variant we need to take note during the game. So you need a bit of paper and a
    pen or pencil. The recommended way of taking note is to draw a table with the player names in the first column, and
    then have columns for each route length: 1 to 6. Only take note at the time a route is built with terrain cards. You
    just put a tick mark in the cell for the player and route length. So at the game end you input in the app for each
    player how many routes were completed using terrain cards for each route length. The app awards the extra points for
    these routes.</p>
  <p>The <b>Nederland</b> game board gives out bonuses according to loans and toll tokens. Input for each player the
    amount of loans requested and/or toll tokens. The app automatically awards penalties when loans are requested. If a
    player did not request a loan then the player is awarded a bonus for toll tokens according to the table in the game
    rules.</p>
  <p>The <b>United Kingdom</b> variant is the most complex variant in terms of bonuses. For these bonuses to be
    calculated indicate for each player which of the technology cards that award points were bought. There are two cards
    that would require that points be counted during game play. In order to count all points at the end then it is
    required to take note of some simple information.</p>
  <p>If the Steam Turbines card is bought by a player you need to take note of how many ferries where built at the time
    the card is bought. At the time to count moment you enter that number and the total number of built ferries. The app
    awards the corresponding bouns for ferries built after the card was bought.</p>
  <p>Similarly, if the Double Heading card is bought the information for routes built at the time the card is bought
    needs to be noted. At the time to count moment, the correspoding award is given for all routes built after the card
    was bought.</p>
  <p>If a player buys the Equalising Beam card then the information for longest route must be completed just as it would
    be for a variant with the longest route bonus.</p>
  <p>The <b>Pennsylvania</b> game board variant has bonuses awarded according to shares owned by players. Enter for each
    player how many shares they have for each share type and also which is the first share of the type the player bought
    (the lowest numbered share). This is used for determing who gets more points in case of a tie in number of shares.
    The app awards the shares bonus according to the rules.</p>
  <p>The <b>Old West</b> variant is the most tricky variant in order to be able to count points at the time to count
    moment. Since points are awarded differently when a route has cities in one or both of it's ends then it is requied
    to take note how the points are ro be awarded differently than it would be if no cities were present. So, for this
    variant you need to paper and pen to take note during gameplay.</p>
  <p>The recommended way of taking note is to draw a table with the player names in the first column, and then have
    another column for taking note of points. Only take note at the time a route is built with cities. If the route has
    another player's city then put the value in points with a plus sign for the player(s) owning the city. If the player
    who built the route also has a city then you do not need to take special note because the route needs to be counted
    for normally; but if the player does not own a city then you need to put the point value for that route with a
    negative sign for that player. This is done to substract the points that will be counted at the end. So at the game
    end you just input the sum of all the numbers you input for each player during game play.</p>
